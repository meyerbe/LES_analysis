- entropies.py: sv_c() -- correct to set it to zero if pv=0?

- pv_star_1 > p0 --> qv_star_1<0 (bcs. in calculation qv_star_c: pd<0) --> qt>qv_star_1 (saturated even for qt=0) but pv=0

# Statistics
`EM_PDF`: fit Gaussian mixed model (GMM)  by using the 'expectation-maximation' (EM) algorithm
        and save parameters (means, covariances, weights) in nc-files
        using scikit package: sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture
        --> output means, covariances and relative weights
`EM_PDF_univariate`: fit uni-variate Gaussian mixed model (GMM) using the 'expectation-maximation' (EM)
        algorithm and save parameters (means, covariances, weights) in nc-files
        using scikit package: sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture
        --> output means, covariances and relative weights
`EM_PDF_plot`: read in output from EM_PDF.py / EM_PDF_univariate.py & plot PDFs from Gaussian
`EM_PDF_stochastic`: read in files with GMM parameters and feed to auto-regression (AR) model (VAR model)

        using statsmodel package (former scikits.statsmodels)
        --> output AR matrices

#Thermodynamics
**Saturation Adjustment:**

`thermodynamics_1`: offline saturation adjustment with (Clausius Clapeyron by Magnus Formula; saturation adjustment) as in LES;
                    normal loop --> gives nan in T

`thermodynamics_2`: same as thermodynamics_1, but with correction on first iteration loop (qv_star_1 > 0)

`thermodynamics_3`: same as thermodynamics_1, but with additional corrections on all iteration loop (qv_star_i > 0, or equivalently T<373K or pd>0)

`thermodynamics_4`: same as thermodynamics_1, but with correction in T_2 --> if pv_star_2>p0: T_2 = 371K
    - T_2 <= 371K:
            if pv_star_2[i,j] >= p0:
                T_2[i,j] = 371.0 K
                ...
    - T_2 <= 350K:
            if T_2[i,j] >= 350:
                T_2[i,j] = 350.0 K
                ...

`CC_Magnus`: saturation adjustment _'step by step'_, Clausius Clapeyron with Magnus formula and from PyCLES
