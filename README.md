- entropies.py: sv_c() -- correct to set it to zero if pv=0?

- pv_star_1 > p0 --> qv_star_1<0 (bcs. in calculation qv_star_c: pd<0) --> qt>qv_star_1 (saturated even for qt=0) but pv=0 
    --> changed formulation for (saturated && pv==0) to s_1 = s (initial entropy)
- if continuing saturated thermodynamics with qt=0, pv=0:  
    --> pv_star_2 >> pv_star_1 >> p0 --> qv_star_2 << qv_star_1


- s_1 negative for

# Thermodynamics
thermodynamics_1: offline saturation adjustment with normal loop --> gives nan in T
thermodynamics_2: same as thermodynamics_1, but with correction on first iteration loop (qv_star_1 > 0)
thermodynamics_3: same as thermodynamics_1, but with additional corrections on all iteration loop (qv_star_i > 0, or equivalently T<373K or pd>0)
thermodynamics_4: same as thermodynamics_1, but with correction in T_2 --> if pv_star_2>p0: T_2 = 371K
    - T_2 <= 371K:
            if pv_star_2[i,j] >= p0:
                T_2[i,j] = 371.0 K
                ...
    - T_2 <= 350K:
            if T_2[i,j] >= 350:
                T_2[i,j] = 350.0 K
                ...


CC_Magnus: saturation adjustment 'step by step', Clausius Clapeyron with Magnus formula and from PyCLES
CC_Magnus_mod: like CC_Magnus, but with modified T_2 formulation (if T_2>373.3K: set T_2=373.3K)

thermo_plot: simple file for plotting thermodynamic relations (e.g. defined in thermo_aux)
